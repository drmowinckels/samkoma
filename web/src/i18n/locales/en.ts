// Keys are flat, dotted, and namespaced by surface (`nav.*`, `landing.*`,
// `create.*`, …). A value is a string or a plural group ({ one, other });
// `{name}` placeholders are filled at call time, and a `\n` renders as a line
// break where the call site opts into it.

// To add a language, copy this file to `<code>.ts`, keep every key, translate
// the values, and register it in `../registry.ts`. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
