              samkoma began as the scheduling brain behind <strong>Jinx</strong>
              , the R-Ladies+ community bot — but it's built to stand on its
              own. Jinx is simply one consumer of the public API; anyone can be
              another. The product is deliberately <strong>independent</strong>:
              not tied to any single community or company, and not anyone's
              growth funnel.

                samkoma runs on free tiers and stays free to use — no paywalls,
                no “pro” plan. If it saved you an email thread or two and you'd
                like to chip in toward the upkeep, you can buy me a coffee.
